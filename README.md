# JWW UIKit Extensions

A set of extensions and types I tend to write for every project I work on.

## Contents

* **SegueIdenfitiable**: A protocol to add additional type safety to storyboard segues. 
* **StoryboardInitializable**: A protocol that makes it easy to vend off a type-safe view controller from a storyboard file.
* **UIView+Extensions**: An extension to `UIView` to add the `usesAutoLayout` property.
* **UIViewController+Containment** An extension to `UIViewController` that adds additional convenience functions for managing parent-child relationships between view controllers.
