# JWW UIKit Extensions

A set of extensions and types I tend to write for every project I work on.

## Contents

1. **SegueIdenfitiable**: A protocol to add additional type safety to storyboard segues. 
2. **UIView+Extensions**: An extension to `UIView` to add the `usesAutoLayout` property.
3. **UIViewController+Containment** An extension to `UIViewController` that adds additional convenience functions for managing parent-child relationships between view controllers.
